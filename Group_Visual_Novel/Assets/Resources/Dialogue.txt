-- DIALOGUE GUIDE
-- 1. use -- to mark thoughts down that the 'SceneManager' will ignore when reading this
-- 2. use #Conversation to mark the start of a new conversation
-- 3. use Character_Name to set what character speaks the following lines
-- 4. surround text in quotations ("") to create a line of dialogue
-- 5. advanced parts are described in depth below (choices, dialogue conditions, and/or logic)

-- IMPORTANT you guys can write conversations in this format wherever and I will insert it into this file later 
-- (or you can edit the text of this file yourself using the GitHub Repository :), ask for help with that and i gotchu)

-- EXTRA
-- empty lines are ignored dw abt them
-- one command per line for the time being
-- I will add commands for scene changes, sprite changes, effects, etc. as we go. If you request what you need things will go faster!

-- CODING
-- no one is required to code or touch Unity at all because I am so awesome however, if you want to I can walk anyone through downloading Unity and pulling the project from the repository
-- (requirements) Downloading Unity, making a unity account, having a GitHib account, an hour or so :]

-- CHOICES
-- start with #choice to makr a choice node
-- format choices like so:
--		"Option A" -> (conversation you go to) | (result of change) | (choice conditions)
--      EX: Speak politely." -> Polite | reputation += 2 | hasPass == true && friendshipWithGuard >= 3
--          - takes player to Polite converation, give 2 reputation, and requirees both having the pass and having at least 3 friendship points with the guard to select this choice
--      - multiple results: use ; between results
          EX: Speak politely." -> Polite | reputation += 2; honnor += 5 | isNice && isCaring


-- DIALOGUE CONDITIONS
-- if you want dialogue to displayed based on a condition use #If condition_name
-- EX: #If strength >= 3
--     Character_Guard
