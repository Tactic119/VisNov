-- DIALOGUE GUIDE
-- 1. use -- to mark thoughts down that the 'SceneManager' will ignore when reading this
-- 2. use #Conversation to mark the start of a new conversation
-- 3. use Character_Name to set what character speaks the following lines
-- 4. surround text in quotations ("") to create a line of dialogue

-- IMPORTANT you guys can write conversations in this format wherever and I will insert it into this file later 
-- (or you can edit the text of this file yourself using the GitHub Repository :), ask for help with that and i gotchu)

-- EXTRA
-- empty lines are ignored dw abt them
-- one command per line for the time being
-- I will add commands for scene changes, sprite changes, effects, etc. as we go. If you request what you need things will go faster!

-- CODING
-- no one is required to code or touch Unity at all because I am so awesome however, if you want to I can walk anyone through downloading Unity and pulling the project from the repository
-- (requirements) Downloading Unity, making a unity account, having a GitHib account, an hour or so :]
